## 🔗 Integration Guide

Use nerd-components as a git submodule in your projects for easy updates and maintenance.

### Setup (One-time in your project)

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/janhjordie/nerd-components.git 00-nerd-components
```

This clones the nerd-components into a `00-nerd-components` folder at your project root.

### Using Components in Your Project

Reference the packages from the submodule in your `.csproj` files:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <ProjectReference Include="../../00-nerd-components/src/TheNerdCollective.Helpers/TheNerdCollective.Helpers.csproj" />
  <ProjectReference Include="../../00-nerd-components/src/TheNerdCollective.Services/TheNerdCollective.Services.csproj" />
  <!-- Add other packages as needed -->
</ItemGroup>
```

### Keep Components Updated

```bash
git submodule update --remote
```

### Contributing Back

Improved helpers, services, or components? Make them publicly available:

1. **Create** the feature locally in your project
2. **Move** it to the appropriate package folder in nerd-components (or create a new public package)
3. **Update** its namespace to `TheNerdCollective.*`
4. **Push** to [nerd-components repo](https://github.com/janhjordie/nerd-components)
5. **Publish** to [NuGet.org](https://nuget.org) via GitHub Actions

Over time, nerd-components becomes a richer, reusable foundation across all your projects.
